Tank Auth w/ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
===================================================

> **This fork is Under Development**. If you're fine using my previous fork of Tank Auth which features a basic role system then please do so. If you want something more flexible (recommended), then use this.

This new version of Tank Auth implements the **Role-Based Access Control** method (Responsibility-based). This makes it more flexible than my previous commits. For more info on RBAC, refer to [this RBAC post](http://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/role-based-access-control.html 'Role-Based Access Control').

To do:
------
1. *Replace default captcha with [Cool Captcha](http://code.google.com/p/cool-php-captcha/)* - **complete**
2. Add custom fields to the registration page
3. RBAC integration
4. Autocreate accounts
5. Integrate [Fieldigniter](https://github.com/enchance/Fieldigniter) for generating fields
6. Buy myself an ice cream
7. CI authentication for AJAX fields

This is a fork of [Tank Auth](http://www.konyukhov.com/soft/tank_auth/) by Ilya Konyukhov.

1. Implement Cool Captcha instead of the default captcha - *Aug 29, 2012*
