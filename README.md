Tank Auth w/ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
==============================================

> **This fork is Under Development and is not yet usable in its current form**. If you're fine using my previous fork of Tank Auth which features a basic role system then please use that instead. If you want something more flexible (recommended), then use this (once it's been completed).

This new version of Tank Auth implements the **Role-Based Access Control** method. This makes it more flexible than any of my previous commits. For more info on RBAC, refer to [this RBAC post](http://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/role-based-access-control.html 'Role-Based Access Control').

To do:
------
1. *Replace default captcha with [Cool Captcha](http://code.google.com/p/cool-php-captcha/)* - **complete**
2. *Add custom fields to the registration page* - **complete**
3. RBAC integration
4. Autocreate accounts
5. Integrate [Fieldigniter](https://github.com/enchance/Fieldigniter) for generating fields
6. Buy myself an ice cream
7. CI authentication for AJAX fields

This is a fork of [Tank Auth](http://www.konyukhov.com/soft/tank_auth/) by Ilya Konyukhov.

Changelog

1. Add custom fields to the registration page - *Sep 10, 2012*
